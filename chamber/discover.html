        Go to Salvador and look what makes it an amazing place

        <p>
          Salvador is the capital and largest city of Bahia. The municipality
          was founded in 1549 as the first capital of Brazil. Its history is
          linked to the arrival of the Portuguese on the Brazilian coast, more
          specifically in the region of Ba√≠a de Todos os Santos, considered
          strategically suitable for the installation of a capital. After
          several historical events, the capital of Brazil was transferred to
          Rio de Janeiro and, more recently, to Bras√≠lia. However, Salvador
          remains one of the main urban centers in Brazil. The city is one of
          the most populous and economically developed in the country, with an
          emphasis on the tertiary sector of the local economy, notably tourism.
        </p>
        <p>
          The main attractions of the old capital are its strong culture and its
          happy, hospitable, musical, mystical, and creative people. It has a
          tropical climate with clear and sunny days in all seasons of the year
          and many quiet beaches with coconut trees, safe waters, and very
          pleasant temperatures, such as the beaches of Porto da Barra, Farol da
          Barra, Piat√£, Itapu√£, Stella Maris, Aleluia and many others. City sung
          in prose and verse around the world, it is the birthplace of great
          poets and artists. There are lots of music, ginga, dengo, rhythms, and
          vibrant celebrations on every street corner, square, and street corner
          of the city. There are numerous parties and Carnival in Salvador,
          which is recognized as one of the largest and best in the world and,
          by far, the city's largest public event and cultural economy. The
          Historic Center of Salvador, also called Pelourinho, is the largest
          colonial architectural complex in Brazil, recognized as a World
          Heritage Site by UNESCO. There are, in addition to historic churches
          and colonial townhouses, theaters, museums, cultural centers, shops,
          restaurants, bars, and an infinity of other attractions. There are
          countless motivations for this unique city of Salvador in all segments
          of travel, events, and business tourism. Salvador is a city that
          cannot be described: it is experienced. Salvador is a feast for the
          senses! Elevador Lacerda: an elevator that connects two cities; Trio
