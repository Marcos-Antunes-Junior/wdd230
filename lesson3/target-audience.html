        <h2>Persona 1 and Scenario</h2>
        <p>
          Lucas is 35 years old and has a degree in Business Management. Four
          years ago, he opened two technology stores, where he sells
          smartphones, laptops, desktops, and computer hardware. Lucas wants to
          open a third store in Salvador, as he knows there is a large flow of
          people and that it would be a great investment. He also wants to
          strengthen and receive support from local businesses so that he can
          succeed. For this reason, while searching on Google and social media,
          Lucas found the Barra Lighthouse website and was able to join us in
          achieving his goal.

        <h2>Persona 2 and Scenario</h2>
        <p>
          Amanda is 45 years old and owns a grocery store in the neighborhood of
          Brotas, Salvador. She manages to sell her products every month but is
          not making progress in her business. When looking for resources to
          move her business forward, Amanda found the Barra Lighthouse website
          on Google, where she was very interested in participating to
          strengthen her local business.
