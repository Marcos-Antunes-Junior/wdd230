        <h3>Repetition</h3>
        <h4>Opex</h4>
        <a target="_blank" href="https://onepieceex.net/">onepieceex.net</a>

        <p>
          This is a fan-made One Piece anime site, where we can see the
          principle of repetition being used a lot. The principle of repetition
          consists of repeating a single element several times. Here we can see
          the repetition of white icons on a red background. We can also see the
          red color in the fonts being used on white backgrounds, accompanied by
          a lighter red color. There is also a repetition of a rectangle after
          the header containing shortcuts for the user.

        <h3>Alignment</h3>

        <h4>NASA</h4>
        <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nasa.gov/">nasa.gov</a>
        <img src="images/nasa.jpg" alt="nasa website screenshot" />
        <p>
          This is NASA's website and we can see the principle of alignment
          there. Alignment brings order to elements and connects them, making
          content more organized and easier to view. On this site, due to the
          alignment, we can see all the news below lined up on the screen as we
          scroll down.

        <h3>Contrast</h3>
        <h4>Amazon</h4>
        <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/">amazon.com</a>
        <img src="images/amazon.jpg" alt="amazon website screenshot" />
        <p>
          On the Amazon website, there are many design principles that we can
          observe. One is the contrast. Contrast is important so that the
          letters are legible against a given background, with fonts that, in
          addition to adding beauty to the content, make it easy to see. With
          contrast, it is possible to draw the user's attention to a specific
          item. In this case, above the sofa image, the black letters on a light
          colored background draw our attention to the product and the offer.
